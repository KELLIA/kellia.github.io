                          <p>The Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae is a publication platform of Egyptian texts of pharaonic times made available by the project "Structure and Transformation in the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language" (former Ancient Egyptian Dictionary Project) at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Saxon Academy of Sciences in Leipzig. The project collaborates with other projects who contribute electronic annotated texts, too. Within the Thesaurus, a digital corpus of Egyptian (including Demotic) texts have been released to the public for computer-assisted search. Lemmatization and morpho-syntactic annotation of the text material allow for specific research from lexical, philological, linguistic, and historico-cultural points of view.</p><hr>

                                        <p>The project Database and Dictionary of Greek Loanwords in Coptic aims to produce a comprehensive lexicographical compilation and description of Greek loanwords in Coptic and pre-Coptic Egyptian texts, as well as Arabic loanwords, across all dialects and text types, thus examining over 1,500 years of contact-induced langauge change of the Egyptian-Coptic language. Following a pilot phase funded by the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (2010-2012), Prof. Dr. Tonio Sebastian Richter has led the project at Leipzig University (2010-2015), and at the Free University of Berlin (2015-present) under the auspices of the German Research Council (DFG), with a projected date of completion of 2024.</p>

<p>“PAThs” aims to provide an in-depth diachronic understanding and eﬀective representation of the geography of Coptic literary production, a corpus of texts written in the Coptic language, of almost exclusive religious contents, produced in Egypt between the 3rd and the 11th centuries. “PAThs” has the ambition to progressively become an exhaustive repertory of the Coptic literary manuscript tradition and therefore to turn into a pivotal resource for the study of Coptic literature. At present “PAThs” is still in a growing phase, but trustfully users can already ﬁnd most of what they are looking for.
The data hosted and managed by “PAThs” are organized in an online relational database system, easily updatable and manageable. The initial core of data will be progressively expanded, hopefully also thanks to the precious work of external contributors, who are encouraged to make suggestions and provide additional data.“PAThs” aims to provide an in-depth diachronic understanding and eﬀective representation of the geography of Coptic literary production, a corpus of texts written in the Coptic language, of almost exclusive religious contents, produced in Egypt between the 3rd and the 11th centuries. “PAThs” has the ambition to progressively become an exhaustive repertory of the Coptic literary manuscript tradition and therefore to turn into a pivotal resource for the study of Coptic literature.</p>

<p>The Collaborative Research Centre investigates constellations of education and religion in Greco-Roman religion, Judaism, Christianity and Islam from the 5th century BCE to the 13th century CE. Research is guided by the assumption that investigating the relationship of education and religion will provide deeper insights into cultural, social, and religious dynamics which were fundamental in these cultures and religions; moreover, this research agenda will also be instrumental in revealing the historical roots of contemporary debates about education and religion. ‘Education’ will be conceptualized by differentiating processes of socialization, education and the development of critical reflection on God, the world, and the self. ‘Religion’ comprises discourses, practices, and institutions which are based on the presupposition of the relationship to a being beyond human everyday experience. These concepts allow for an analysis of phenomena and constellations, employing typological as well as genealogical comparisons.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this interdisciplinary team studies the linguistic and literary phenomenon that is text reuse with a particular focus on historical languages. More specifically, we look at how ancient authors copied, alluded to, paraphrased and translated each other as they spread their knowledge in writing. This early career research group seeks to provide a basic understanding of the historical text reuse methodology (it being distinct from plagiarism), and so to study what defines text reuse, why some people reuse information, how text is reused and how this practice has changed over history. We’ll be investigating text reuse on big data or, in other words, datasets that, owing to their size, cannot be manually processed.</p>
